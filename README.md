# BF1942 DataField42
A Battlefield 1942 tool for automatic map/mod downloads.\
The tool is still in a very early stage.
## Features:
- Download of a map from the central database after connecting to a server instead of the message "MAP NOT FOUND".
	(requires that the client has the mod already)
## ToDo for v1.0:
- Download of a mod from the central database after connecting to a server instead of the message "MAP NOT FOUND".
## ToDo long term:
- Download of a map/mod from the server (to which the client wanted to connect) after connecting to the server if its not available in the central database.
